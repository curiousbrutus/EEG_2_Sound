EEG_2_Sound
EEG Music Generation
Overview
This project aims to transform EEG (electroencephalogram) data into a musical experience. By processing EEG data and mapping it to musical elements, it offers a distinctive auditory journey.

Getting Started
To install the required packages, run:

------
pip install -r requirements.txt
------


To generate music from EEG data, execute:

---------
python eeg_to_music.py
---------

Custom Chords
Feel free to write your own chords to generate new and unique sounds. The mapping of EEG data to musical elements allows for creative exploration.

Upcoming Features
Planning for future enhancements includes:
- EEG Data Acquisition: Utilize compatible EEG hardware for real-time data acquisition.
- Signal Processing: Enhance preprocessing for optimal feature extraction.
- Feature Extraction: Expand methods to capture diverse EEG characteristics.
- Mapping to Music Parameters: Develop a versatile strategy for EEG-music parameter mapping.
- Real-Time Mapping: Implement adaptive real-time mapping for dynamic EEG features.
- Generate Music Notes: Enhance real-time generation with varied waveforms.
- Audio Playback: Integrate diverse sound libraries for high-quality playback.
- Experimentation and Iteration: Allow dynamic adjustments based on user feedback.
